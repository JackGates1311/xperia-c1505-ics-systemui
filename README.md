## üîÑ Key Modifications

‚úÖ Latin Script Support

- Adjusted date/time strings and UI elements to show Serbian Latin instead of Cyrillic script.

üß∞ Toggle Panel (Quick Settings)

- Pulled toggle logic and icons from on/off tools.

- Re-enabled, fixed, or removed toggles based on their current compatibility with the C1505 hardware and framework.

üßπ Cleanup

- Removed dead toggles and services no longer supported or required.

- Streamlined Smali methods for clarity and stability.

ü™≤ Bug Fixes

- Fixed non-functional quick settings.

- Fixed bugs related to SystemUI crashes.

- Fixed Airplane mode strings by matching framework-res references.

- Resolved non-mentioned string mismatches.

- Adjusted behavior of long-press actions (e.g., quick access to Settings).

- Graphics are adopted for single SIM variant.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The code in this repository is intended for **Xperia E (C1505)**, but the system apps were decompiled from **Xperia Tipo‚Äôs** Android 4.0.4 firmware due to its simpler app structure, making it easier to patch for compatibility with the C1505.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Initial commit contains already patched and decompiled code. There is no commit history of individual changes. Only commit is available for patching storage framework-res strings.

## üîß How to Modify and Rebuild the Settings App (Smali Code)

### 1. **Prepare the Environment**

You‚Äôll need **Apktool** and **Smali/Baksmali** to work with the decompiled APK.

- **Install Apktool**:
  - On **Ubuntu**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install apktool
    ```

  - On **macOS** (via Homebrew):
    ```bash
    brew install apktool
    ```

  - On **Windows**, download the latest version from the [Apktool website](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool) and set it up following the instructions.

- **Install Smali/Baksmali**:
  - Smali and Baksmali come bundled with Apktool.

---

### 2. **Decompile the SystemUI APK (not needed, already is decompiled)**

To make changes to the **SystemUI app**, decompile it into a working folder.

- **Command to decompile**:
```bash
apktool d systemui_port/apks/SystemUI_rev8.apk -o SystemUI_rev8
```
### 3. Modify the Smali Code

The decompiled `SystemUI_rev8.apk` will be in Smali format. You can edit the Smali and resource files to make necessary changes. Smali is a lower-level language that represents the compiled Java code in a human-readable format.

#### Example Modifications:

##### Modify a class or method:
- Navigate to the relevant Smali files inside `SystemUI_rev8/smali/`.
- Open and modify the desired classes or methods, such as changing the behavior of settings activity or adding new settings.

##### Adjust the layout:
- Modify the XML files under `res/layout/` to change the UI components, such as adding or removing elements.

### 4. Rebuild the APK

Once the modifications are done, rebuild the APK.

- **Command to rebuild**:
```bash
apktool b SystemUI_rev8/ -o SystemUI_modified.apk
```

### 5. Sign the APK (workaround way)

Since you don't have a signing key, we will use a workaround to patch the original APK.
Steps:

- Locate the original **SystemUI_rev8.apk** in the system directory at **apks/SettingsUI_rev8.apk.**

- Copy the APK and rename it to a .zip file (e.g., Settings.zip).

- Open the .zip file and navigate to the **classes.dex** file.

- Replace the **existing classes.dex** file with the **modified one** from the **SystemUI_modified.apk** generated earlier.

- After replacing **classes.dex**, re-archive the contents into a **.zip** file.

- Finally, rename the **.zip** back to **.apk** (e.g., Settings.apk).

### 6. **Install the Patched System APK (Manually with `adb push`)**

Since the **Settings.apk** is a system app, you must replace it in the `/system/app/` directory, not install it using `adb install`.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:
Make sure your device is rooted and has `adb root` access. Replacing a system app improperly may cause the device to crash or bootloop.

#### Steps:

1. **Remount `/system` as read-write:**

   ```bash
   adb root
   adb remount
   ```

2. **Push the patched APK to the device:**

   ```bash
    adb push SystemUI_modified.apk /system/app/SystemUI.apk
   ```

3. **Set correct permissions:**

   ```bash
   adb shell chmod 644 /system/app/SystemUI.apk
   ```

4. **Reboot the device:**

   ```bash
    adb reboot
   ```

After rebooting, the system should load the new patched version of **SystemUI.apk.**

### 7. Test the Changes

Once the APK is installed, check the device to ensure that the changes are applied. Open the **Settings** app and verify if your modifications are in place. If there are issues, review the Smali and XML files to confirm the patches were applied correctly.

## üìù Conclusion

Using Apktool and Smali/Baksmali, you can decompile, modify, and rebuild the SystemUI app for the Xperia E (C1505) based on the Xperia Tipo‚Äôs Android 4.0.4 firmware. This process allows for easy patching and tweaking of core system apps.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

- This code is intended **only for educational use or for legacy ROM development**.

- Be sure to backup your **SystemUI** and ensure compatibility with your current build.

- Using a mismatched **framework-res.apk** or **Settings.apk** may cause **SystemUI** crashes or bootloops.
